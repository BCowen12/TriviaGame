The purpose of the was to show the use of timers in Javascript. I had to create a trivia game of my chosing that had a countdown as the player played it and would start the next question a few seconds after displaying the answer.

To do this I untilized timers in javascript in order for it to start the next step in the app.

Overall this was a very straightforward app with very few hickups when creating it. 

My only regret on this app is that I didn't spend more time on the design but the purpose is to show that I have the javascript abilities to make it handle as expected.
